Be Aware! Your trusted contacts should be people that you know personally and should be prepared and able to respond fast. Questions to ask: - Who in my network can practically help me in an emergency? - Have I told these people they are a trusted contact? - Have I created a security plan so they know what to do if they receive the Panic message?
