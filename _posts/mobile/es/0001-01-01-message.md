Think first! Your emergency message needs to clearly communicate that you need help in only a few words. Questions to ask: - Does your message work for all situations? - How often should you review and change it? - Would it be wise to create a code message with your contacts? - Do you want to enable GPS tracking from your phone settings so that your location sends with your emergency message?
