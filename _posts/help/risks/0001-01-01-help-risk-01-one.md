First, assess your risk. Only you know how security conscious you need to be. The consequences of surveillance and harassment have the potential to be severe; but, being overly cautious and constantly preparing for the worst can be debilitating. Ask yourself, what threats do you face? How serious would it be if that threat became reality? How likely is that to happen?

**The likelihood that you aren't ready for a threat, and that it will become a reality is risk. Many factors affect your risk. Planning for these factors will help you to defend against risk.**

  **First step: assessing the threat**

Sometimes a threat may be explicit. Not all explicit threats will lead to an incident. After all threatening you may be easy, but attacks are expensive. Other times, a threat will be implicit. You may be concerned that you are under threat because of another attack on someone else.

It is good to think about what the person or group threatening you aims to achieve and whether their motive is great enough for them to take the risk. Think about this in terms of what they have to gain versus what they have to lose. This will help you to decide if the risk of the threat becoming a reality is low, medium , or high.

Five steps to assessing a threat:
1. Establish the facts surrounding the threat(s).
2. Establish whether there is a pattern of threats over time.
3. Establish the objective of the threat (what they have to gain)
4. Establish who is making the threat and what they might have to lose
5. Make a reasonable conclusion about whether or not the threat can be put into action (are they equipped enough?)

**Second step: reducing your vulnerability to a threat**

Vulnerability to a threat depends on your circumstances and how well equipped you are to stop the threat from harming you if it becomes reality. 

Some factors that increase or reduce vulnerability include access or lack of access to:
■ Effective and secure means of communication
■ Safe, ground transportation
■ Proper locks or other physical security protections for a house or office
■ Support from others (a network or system) in the event of attack 

Vulnerabilities and threats also vary according to gender, age and other factors.

To reduce your vulnerability it is important to increase your capacity to defend against and respond to a threat by having a clear and effective security plan in place. For starters, it is a good idea to develop and maintain an up-to-date checklist that covers the following:
1. Managing information (physical and digital) in a secure manner
2. Maintaining a contact list and network that can provide information about attacks and will advocate on your behalf should you be victimized 
3.Deciding who your emergency contacts are in the event of a threat 
4. Deciding who should know who your emergency contacts are (and making sure to let them know)
5. Making a recovery plan (should be tested in practice)
